# CATS
Welcome to our blog for CATS (Constructing Algorithmic Trading Structures) â€” a market data project completed for STAT 359 in winter 2021. The goal of our project is to construct a data processing pipeline that can retreive, process, and analyze level 1 and level 2 market data.

## Pipeline Overview

## Data Processing
### Qlib
One of the most important tools for data processing is Qlib, an AI-oriented investment platform. Extensive documentation for Qlib can be found [here](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and the official repository can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib). Qlib provides many useful data-processing child classes. An exhaustive list can be found in the aforementioned documentation, but the ones that are most relevant to our project can be found in the processor.
